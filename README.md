# TrailCam


**Wifi & Bluetooth driven, LoRaWAN enabled, battery powered mini TraiLCam built on cheap ESP32 LoRa IoT boards**


# Use case

TraaILCAM is an [ESP32](https://www.espressif.com/en/products/socs/esp32) MCU based device for metering passenger flows in realtime. It counts how many mobile devices are around. This gives an estimation how many people are around. TraLCam detects Wifi and Bluetooth signals in the air, focusing on mobile devices by evaluating their MAC adresses.

Intention of this project is NOT to do this without intrusion in privacy: This will explicitly track devices, not just count them. Therefore, TrailCam does persistenly store MAC adresses and does of fingerprinting the scanned devices.

Data can either be stored on a local SD-card, transferred to cloud using LoRaWAN network (e.g. TheThingsNetwork or Helium) or MQTT over TCP/IP, or transmitted to a local host using serial (SPI) interface.

You can build this project battery powered using ESP32 deep sleep mode and reach long uptimes with a single 18650 Li-Ion cell.
